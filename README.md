# Game-Developer-Scripts
Here are all of the scripts I've written to help myself and others get there game development going! Use the scripts as you wish in conjunction with my tutorials.

Thanks to @yafd for inspiring a lot of my bullet mechanic scripts.
Thanks to @KenneyWings for making wonderful free art assets.

1. Bullet Pooling
This set of scripts are everything a beginner would need to get started with object pooling. Try to write the code line by line as you follow the tutorial to understand how every piece works.

-Bullet1 - This script creates an object pool for a user set amount of projectiles they can fire from.
Make sure you have the appropriate prefabs setup or else the script will not function. Use the "Bullet" and "Gun" tags for your launcher and projectile.

-BulletKill - This script kills the bullets and returns them to the pool location. Make sure you have the boundaries of your gamespace tagged as "killzone."
