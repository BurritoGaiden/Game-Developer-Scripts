# Game-Developer-Scripts
Here are all of the scripts I've written to help myself and others get there game development going!

Thanks to @yafd for inspiring a lot of my bullet mechanic scripts.

1. Bullet Pooling
-Bullet1 - This script creates an object pool for a user set amount of projectiles they can fire from.
-BulletKill - This script kills the bullets and returns them to the pool location.
